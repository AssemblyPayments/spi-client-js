# SPI Client JavaScript [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AssemblyPayments/spi-client-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AssemblyPayments/spi-client-js)

This is the JavaScript client library for Assembly Payments in-store integration.

# Setup

Below are basic instructions on how to run the library for development. If all you want to do is use the library in your project, just import [@assemblypayments/spi-client-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@assemblypayments/spi-client-js) from npm.

## Building

To download the dependencies and install the package, run the following:

```
npm install
```

## Testing

To run a suite of unit tests configured in `karma.conf.js`, run the following:

```
npm test
```

## Creating a distribution

This will update the `dist/spi-client.js.js` file used for the npm package.
